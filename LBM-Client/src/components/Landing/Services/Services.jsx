            <p>
              Libertum Project services are divided into 3 categories and were
              developed in 3 different stages. In
              the first stage we developed the DeFi 1.0 loans component with the functionality of
              minting stablecoins, in the second stage we finalized the real estate investment
              marketplace which provides for the tokenization of property, and in the last stage we created an environment where we encourage other projects to take part in
              offering loan services backed by real estate property collateral
